# Exercise 2

## Goals

- Run recusive functions and trace the recursion process by hand
- Declare, write and call basic recursive functions in C
- Declare, write and call mutual and multiple recursive functions in C
- Write and compare iterative and recursive functions in C

## Recursion

### Task 1. Basic Recursion

Write the recursive function int exponent(int x, int pow) in C that computes the exponent of the base. An input/output example is illustrated below (input is typeset in bold):

```
Please enter the base: 2
Please enter the power: 3
The result is: 8
```

### Task 2. Multiple Recursion

In a sequence a(n) = a1, a2, ... , an with n >= 3 integers, the first two integers a1 = 1 and a2 = 2 are fixed. For i >= 3

1. Determine a3 and a4, aketch the trace process of your recursive function and calculate how many times your recursive function is called
2. Write the recursive function int sequence(int n) in C that computes and prints all the integers if a(n)

### Task 3. Iteration and Recursion
