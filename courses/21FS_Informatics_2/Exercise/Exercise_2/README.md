# Exercise 2

## Goals

- Run recusive functions and trace the recursion process by hand
- Declare, write and call basic recursive functions in C
- Declare, write and call mutual and multiple recursive functions in C
- Write and compare iterative and recursive functions in C

## Recursion

### Task 1. Basic Recursion

Write the recursive function int exponent(int x, int pow) in C that computes the exponent of the base. An input/output example is illustrated below (input is typeset in bold):

```
Please enter the base: **2**
Please enter the power: **3**
The result is: 8
```

### Task 2. Multiple Recursion

In a sequence $a(n) = a_1$
