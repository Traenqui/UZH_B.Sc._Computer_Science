## Indroduction to C

### Task 1. Reverse String

Write a C program with a function void reverse(char s[]) that re- verses and prints a given string. Assume that all strings are at most 1000 characters long. Your program should prompt the user for an input string, read the string (terminated by a new line), and print the reversed string to the screen. Do not use any built-in library functions in this task. An input/output example is illustrated below (input is typeset in bold):

'''
Please enter a string to reverse: **Hello World!**
Result String: !dlroW olleH
'''
