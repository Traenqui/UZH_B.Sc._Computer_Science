# Exercise 1

## Goals

- Declare, initialize and use C data type: char, integer.
- Declare, initialize and use one-dimensional array and 2-dimensional array in C.
- Write for-loop in C and, printf function.
- Implement selection sorting algorithm in C.

## Indroduction to C

### Task 1. Reverse String

Write a C program with a function void reverse(char s[]) that re- verses and prints a given string. Assume that all strings are at most 1000 characters long. Your program should prompt the user for an input string, read the string (terminated by a new line), and print the reversed string to the screen. Do not use any built-in library functions in this task. An input/output example is illustrated below (input is typeset in bold):

```
Please enter a string to reverse: **Hello World!**
Result String: !dlroW olleH
```

### Task 2. Perfect Square Number

A perfect square number is an integer that is the square of another integer. Write a C function with a loop bool isPerfectSquare(int num) that determines whether an integer is a perfect square number or not. Your program should prompt the user to type in an integer. After an integer is typed in, your program prints “TRUE” if it is a perfect square number, otherwise, “FALSE”. Do not use any built-in library functions in this task Two input/output examples are illustrated below (input is typeset in bold):

```
Enter an integer: __25__
Perfect Square Number: TRUE
```
