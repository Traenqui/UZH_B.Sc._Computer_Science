# Summary: SL02 Complexity and Correctness

## Algorithmic complexity

### Efficiency

- Predicting the resources that the algorithm requires
  - Resources in terms of time: running time
  - Resources in terms of space: memory usage
- Efficiency (use of resources) depends on input size
- Various ways of determining the size of input data
  - Depends on the problem being studied
  - Number of items in the input (e.g. sorting) 􏰀 Total number of bits (e.g. integer arithmetic)
- Must have a model of the implementation technology

### Best, Worst and Average Case

- Usually, one focuses on worst case running time
- There are basically the following three reasons
  - Worst case running time provides an upper bound
    - Guarantee that algorithm wil never take any longer
  - For some algorithms, worst case occurs fairly often
    - Example:searching for an element that is not present
  - Average case is often roughly as bad as worst case
    - Example:insertion sort is still quadratic on average
- Might be quite difficult to find typical average case

## Binary Search

How many times is the loop executed?

- Each iteration the difference between r, l is cut in half
  - Initially the difference is n
  - Stops when it becomes 0
- How many times do we have to cut n in half to get 0?
  - log2 n — better than brute-force linear search (n)
- Cost of linear versus cost of binary search
  - For n = 0.2M one gets log2 200′000 ≈ 18
  - For n = 2M one gets log2 2′000′000 ≈ 21
  - For n = 20M one gets log2 20′000′000 ≈ 24

```c
int binSearch(int arr[], int n, int v){
    int l = 0;
    int r = n-1;
    int m;

    m = (int)floor((l+r)/2);

    while (l <= r && v != arr[m]){
        if (v < arr[m]){
            r = m-1;
        } else {
            l = m+1;
        }
        m = (int)floor((l+r)/2);
    }

    if (l <= r){
        return m;
    } else {
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Correctness

### Pre/post-conditions

- **Assertion**: statement about the state of execution
  - Example:A[1],...,A[i]formanincreasingsequence
- To prove partial correctness one associates a number of assertions with specific checkpoints in the algorithm
- **Preconditions**: assertions that must be valid before the execution of an algorithm or a subroutine (input)
- **Postconditions**: assertions that must be valid after the execution of an algorithm or a subroutine (output)

## Asymptotic Complexity

#### Logarithm Rules

- log<sub>a</sub>(bc) = log<sub>a</sub>b + log<sub>a</sub>c
- log<sub>a</sub>b=log<sub>c</sub>b/log<sub>c</sub>a
- log<sub>a</sub> b<sup>c</sup> = c log<sub>a</sub> b
- a<sup>m</sup>a<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>m+n</sup>
- a<sup>mn</sup> = (a<sup>m</sup>)<sup>n</sup>
- a<sup>log<sub>a</sub> b</sup> = b
- lg b = ldb = log<sub>2</sub>b
- Notation: log<sub>a</sub> b = <sup>a</sup>log b

### Big-O notation

- Asymptotic upper bound
- Used for worst-case analysis
- f(n) and g(n) are functions over non-negative integers
- f(n) = O(g(n)) if and only if there exist constants c > 0 and n<sub>0</sub> >0 such that f(n) ≤ cg(n) for n ≥ n<sub>0</sub>

### Big-Ω notation

- Asymptotic lower bound
- Used for best-case analysis
- f(n) = Ω(g(n)) if and only if there exist constants c > 0 and n<sub>0</sub> >0 such that cg(n) ≤ f(n) for n≥n<sub>0</sub>

### Big Θ notation

- Asymptotic tight bound
- f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if and only if there exist constants c1 > 0, c2 >0,and n<sub>0</sub> > 0 such that c<sub>1</sub> g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c<sub>2</sub>g(n) for n ≥ n<sub>0</sub>
  - f(n) = Θ(g(n)) iff f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n))
- O(f(n)) is sometimes (ab)used as notation for Θ(f(n))

### Order of Growth

- f(n)=O(g(n)) ↔ f ≤ g
- f(n)=o(g(n)) ↔ f < g
- f(n)=Ω(g(n)) ↔ f ≥ g
- f(n)=ω(g(n)) ↔ f > g
- f(n)=Θ(g(n)) ↔ f = g

### Order of common functions

- constant ,O(1)
- logaritmic ,O(log n)
- liner ,O(n)
- quadratic ,O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- polynomial ,O(n<sup>z</sup>), where z some constant
- exponential ,O(c<sup>n</sup>), where c some constant
- factorial ,O(n!)

## Special case analysis

Special cases

- Data structure (array, list, file, etc.)
  - Empty, single element, completely filled
- Particular values, border of domain
  - Zero, empty string, negative numbers, etc.
- Calling of functions (procedures)
  - Entering function, termination of function
- Control and loop statements
  - Start of loop, end of loop, 1st iterationl
