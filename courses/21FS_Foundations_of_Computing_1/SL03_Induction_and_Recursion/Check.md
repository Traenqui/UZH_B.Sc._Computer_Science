Can you answer the following question:
• Why are iterative/recursive algorithms relevant in computer science?
• Can you trace the execution of an iterative/recursive algorithm?
• Can you illustrate the pros/cons of recursion vs. iteration?
• Can you verify whether a recursive function is correct?
• Can you define what a fractal is and how it works?
• Can you list the steps of the proofs by induction and strong induction?
• Can you prove simple properties defined on integers using the proof by induction or strong induction?
• Can you use induction to prove that the Tromino problem has a solution? Can you find and apply a recursive method to solve it?
• How do we solve the Tower of Hanoi? Can you find and prove an explicit formula for the number of move?
• How does the method by iteration work to find an explicit formula for a recurrence relation?
• Can you find and prove the explicit formula for the generic term of arithmetic and geometric sequences?
• Can you prove the explicit formula for the sum of the first n integers (both by induction and geometrically)?
• Can you prove the explicit formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence (both by induction and by perturbation)? • What is the limit of the sum of a geometric sequence when the constant is greater than 1, equal to 1, between 0 and 1?
• How do we model the onset of a pandemic?
• Can you prove the prime factorization theorem by strong induction?
• Can you define recursively: the sum of the first n integers, the product of the first n integers, the factorial of an integer, the integer
exponentiation, and the GCD algorithm?
• Can you illustrate how the GCD algorithm works (both mathematically and geometrically)?
• Can you list and apply the steps of the method of the loop invariant to prove the correctness of a loop?s
