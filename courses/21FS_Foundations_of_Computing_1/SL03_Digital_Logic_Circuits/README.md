# VL3: Digital Logic Circuits

- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

  Is a combinatorial digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operators on two input integer binary numbers.

- CPU

  central processing unit

- GPU

  graphic processing unit

- Arithmetic operations

  - Addition

    $A+B$

  - Subtraction

    $A-B$

  - Negative representation

    $-A$

  - Increment by 1

    $A + 1$

  - Decrement by 1

    $A -1$

  - Copy to a register

    $R = A$

- Bitwise logical operations

  - Bitwise AND

    $A \land B$

  - Bitwise OR

    $A\lor B$

  - Bitwise XOR

    $A \oplus B$

  - Ones' complement

    all bits are inverts (used to represent negativ integers using tow's cmplement)

  - Bit shift

    all bit values are shifted by one unit to the left and a 0 is added to the right most digit, equivalent to multiplication by 2

- Multiplexer

  A 2-1 Mux, changes the output based on the Selection Input
